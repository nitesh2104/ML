This is a pretty different type of course. If you like to be given set instructions on what to study
and like to work with that mindset, this couse might not be for you.

The instructors seem to have a pretty clear idea on what this course should be like.
They want you to go ahead and do as much research as you can while answering the assignments.
There is no set rubric that you have to follow, no language barrier, no specific library, no specific dataset.

Kinda like, here jump in the pool and learn to swim on the spot. 

Now I personally had to change my mindset to deal with the course. 
I took this course as a way to learn whatever stuff I could within the realms of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning topics. 
And then when Im stuck, I either refer to the book, or simply ask a question in Piazza. 

Kinda like Im getting community support for learning topics in ML in whatever detail suites me. 

So from my perspective, if you want to excel the coures, find the reason as to why you loved ML in the first place, and then, 
feel free to do as much research as you want. No setbacks, no issues if you learn more.

I think this is the first and the last course I will have that really allows you to fly like this.

I enjoyed it cause I learned way more than what the class wanted me to learn. I also ended up implementing open source projects 
non-related to course, that are now maintained open source by other developers.

Long story short - you are thrown in a pool, the only way you can survive is if you love ML and are willing to take a deep dive down
and keep going deeper than their expectations. You will end up with a very strong foundation of ML algo
