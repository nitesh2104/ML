FEATURE SCALING

Feature scaling - to deal with sensitive data 
SOme machines are sensitive to feature scaling while others are invariant to it

Models with Gradient Descent require feature scaling 


Distance based algorithms: KNN and SVM 
- Since the algorithms are based on distance, we need to scale them in order to manager the weights

Tree based algorithms are insensitive to feature scaling for example DT. 
Since its splitting the tree from a single feature at a time, it doesnt care about scaling.

Types: 
Normalization 
Standardization


Standardization: Uni-mode with deviation offset, centered at mean 

Use normalization when the data does not follow Normal Distribution. Useful in KNN and NN
Use standardization when the data does follow Normal Distribution.
