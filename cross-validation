Do it to avoid overfitting

Use K-Folds and create K sets of train and validation data sets from train sets
Shuffle the datasets for validation sets and plot the average

Check if the CV is hiding something by analyzing each result

Stratified K_Fold
returns stratified folds
It maintains the percentage of samples for each class 
in every fold. This way the model gets equally distributed for training/test folds
