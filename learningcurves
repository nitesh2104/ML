Bias: Average Error of different training sets
Variance: How sensitive is it to varying training sets

Learning Curve
Plot against accuracy

Model Complexity Curve
- Notice if over/underfit
- Look at the hyperparameters that are causing it
- Adjust HP by reading the Model Complexity Curve
- Use GridSearch to Tune HP

Learning rate is itself a hyperparameter
No baseline metrics are necessary
